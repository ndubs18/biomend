    <h1>Soil</h1>

    <p>
        Soil is the link between the air, water, rocks, and organisms, and is responsible for many different functions in the natural world that we call ecosystem services. 
        These soil functions include: air quality and composition, temperature regulation, carbon and nutrient cycling, water cycling and quality, natural "waste" (decomposition) 
        treatment and recycling, and habitat for most living things and their food. We could not survive without these soil functions.
    </p>

    <p>
        A well covered soil prevents erosion. During times like the great Dust Bowl, wind blows across soils, 
        and suspended them in the air. These are easily inhaled and accumulate in lung tissues causing major respiratory problems. 
        These particles can contain fungi and bacteria,which can cause infection and diseases. They are also important in military operations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soil temperature plays an important role in many processes, which take place in the soil such as chemical reactions and biological interactions. 
        This includes important processes like seed germination, bugs and microbes that live in the environment, and how quickly plant and animals break down. 
        In colder soils, there is less biological and chemical reactions compared to warmer ones, therefore, there may be more carbon stored in the soils.
    </p>

    <p>
        Without soil and soil particles, water would be running on bare rocks! When it rains, the soil acts as a sponge, soaking water into the ground. 
        From there a few things can happen to the water. The water can be taken up by plants, microbes, and other living things, or the water moves into 
        the underground aquifers and lakes, and flows into streams before eventually making it to the ocean. If rainfall contains harmful pollutants, the soil acts as a filter; 
        contaminants are captured by the soil particles, and the water comes out cleaner in the aquifers and rivers.
    </p>

    <p>Soil filters water as it moves from the land surface into the groundwater.  This occurs through physical, chemical and biological process.  
        For example, septic systems rely on these processes to protect groundwater quality as well as maintain the quantity of our water supply.  
        When soils are not protected, soils and nutrients can pollute water, washing away into streams and oceans. 

    </p>

    <p>
        Application of excess fertilizers, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, can result in runoff to streams and rivers or contamination of groundwater.  In most freshwater systems, 
        phosphorus is the major limiting nutrient for the growth of photosynthetic organisms (e.g., plants, algae, and some microorganisms like phytoplankton).  If a lake or pond receives excess phosphate, 
        it can stimulate these organisms, especially if nitrates are present with it.  These organisms block out the light and consume oxygen in the water to the detriment of other organisms (e.g., other plants and fish).  
        Other symptoms include cloudy water that is typically green or yellow.  Dead plants and fish and cloudy green water make these water bodies uninviting for recreational activities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soils are the stomach that converts these "waste" products into newer, better things that can be reused by other creatures. Everything that is living eats, and because of this, everything needs to expel waste products out of their bodies. 
        Humans and other organisms use the soil to decompose these waste materials into new materials. These new materials are used by other living things. Once a living thing dies, it falls into the soil and the biological and chemical processes 
        convert these dead materials into new materials and food for living things. This is natures way of recycling.

        <h1>Plants</h1>

        <p>
            Around the world, there is an increasing trend in areas of land, surface waters and groundwater affected by contamination from industrial, military and agricultural activities either due to ignorance, lack of vision, or carelessness. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The build-up of toxic pollutants (metals, radionuclides and organic contaminants in soil, surface water and ground water) not only affects natural resources but also causes a major strain on ecosystems. Remediation of contaminated 
            sites using conventional practices, such as â€˜pump-and-treatâ€™ and â€˜dig-and-dumpâ€™ techniques, is often expensive, has limited potential, and is usually only applicable to small areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, these conventional approaches to remediation often make the soil infertile and unsuitable for agriculture and other uses by destroying the microenvironment. Hence there is the need to develop and apply alternative, 
            environmentally sound technologies (ESTs), taking into account the probable end use of the site once it has been remediated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Phytotechnology is the use of vegetation to remediate, contain or prevent contaminants in soils, sediments and groundwater, andâ€™or add nutrients, porosity and organic matter. It is also a set of planning, engineering and design
            tools and cultural practices that can assist landscape architects site designers, engineers and environmental planners in working on current future individual site, the urban fabric and regional landscapes. The vegetation used 
            in phytotech is targeted to be self-sustaining and integrated in the site design.
        </p>
        <div><img src="" alt=""></div>

        <p>
            Remediation is the degradation and/or removal of a particular contaminant on a polluted site by a specific plant or group of plants. While phytotech deals with the degradation and/or removal of a particular contaminant, 
            it also includes the stabilization of pollutants within the surrounding soil or root structure of a plant and the preemptive installation of plant-based approaches so as to treat a pollutant or mitigate an ecological problem before it actually occurs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Phytotech includes all plant-based pollution remediation and prevention systems, including constructed wetlands, bioswales, green roofs, green walls and planted landfill caps. Parks, community gardens and greenways often have phytotechnology components 
            designed into their landscapes, such as protective riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips, where introduced vegetation addresses a range of environmental constraints and pollution control. Phytotech is based on ecological principles and considers the natural systems as an integral component of human and societal interventions. There are an enormous amount of brownfields in this world that without remediation and reclamation will continue to degrade the health of communities. Brownfields include those sites with leaking or obsolete underground oil storage tanks, such as gas stations, former industrial sites and former manufactured-gas plants. 20% of all real estate transfers in the US are brownfield sites, with the current value of these lands in 2010 in the range of $2 trillion. 16% of global land areas are impacted by soil pollution worldwide.

        <h1>Gravel</h1>
        <p>
            The use of sand and gravel as filter media for water supplies can be split into three basic filter types: slow sand filters, rapid filters and roughing filters. Apart from desalination and reverse osmosis, slow sand filters are 
            perhaps the most effective single treatment for purifying drinking water supplies. They are use on a large scale as part of the water supply for large cities, as part of systems for small villages and on a much smaller scale they
             can be adapted for use in individual households. Rapid sand filters are normally require a subsequent chlorination process and are thus of less use for small village supplies unless the raw (untreated) water supply is of a reliably 
             high quality. Roughing filters are used to reduce the turbidity of water supplied and often used as a pre-treatment before slow sand filtration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slow Sand Filters Slow sand filters use sand with effective sizes of 0.15 - 0.35 mm to remove a large percentage of coliforms, cryptospridum and Giardia cysts. They operate most effectively at a flow rate of 0.1 â€“ 0.3 m/h (or m3/h/m2),
            which equates to 100 â€“ 300 l/h per m2 of filter area. These filters use physical processes such as sedimentation, adsorption and straining to remove fine particles as well as microbiological processes to remove organic material and bacteria. 
            Because of the slow filter rates the raw water sits above the sand for several hours before passing through it, various oxidation reactions break down organic material during this time. Algae, that grows on the sand surface, consumes this oxidised 
            organic material and releases oxygen back into the water.
        </p>

        <p>
            Roughing filters and sedimentation are often used as pre-treatments to reduce the turbidity of the raw water and therefore reduce the rate at which the slow sand filter becomes clogged. Some aeration, to increase the oxygen content of the raw water, 
            is also desirable. Post-filtration chlorination or UV-purification can also be used; however, with a filter that is functioning well such treatments  are not strictly necessary. The flow of raw water through the filter should be continuous, however small 
            scale filters, for use in individual households, have been designed to work intermittently (i.e. a few hours a day). These have been widely used in several countries around the world (see section 8).
        </p>

        <p>
            Rapid Sand Filters These filters use coarser sand than slow sand filters and the effective size of the filter media is usually greater than 0.55 mm. The flow rates are normally between 4 and 21 m/h equating to 400 to 2100 l/h per m2 of filter. 
            These filters do not remove disease causing entities as efficiently as slow sand filters and usually need a post filtration chlorination process. Flocculation and coagulation are sometimes used as pre-treatments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Roughing Filters These filters are used to remove suspended solids by passing the water through material that is much coarser than that used in slow sand filtration or rapid sand filters. The filter material is usually graded so that the water 
            passes through coarse (25 mm), medium and then fine (5 mm) sand. Flow rates are often in the region of 0.3 â€“ 0.6 m/h (i.e. 300 â€“ 600 l/h per m2 of filter surface area).
