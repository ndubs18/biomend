                    <p>
                        The site, the East Campus Property, or as it’s more informally know as the Pit, is located to the east of our 
                        Campus (Pitzer and CMC); Is an old gravel quarry that was utilized to help build LA during the 40s and 50s. 
                        The site is located south of Foothill Boulevard, old U.S. Route 66, a national highway. After the quarry shut 
                        down,  the Claremont Colleges Consortium bought the property and later transferred it over to Pitzer and CMC. 
                        The schools used it for events, parties, and art shows for the next couple for decades until it was fenced off. 
                        Both CMC and Pitzer hope to expand their respective campuses, this site offers them a chance. Both Pitzer and CMC 
                        have planned to develop athletic fields. However athletic fields do not realize the full potential of the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Pit is located in what was the watershed between the San Gabriel Valley and the Santa Ana, at the foothills 
                        of the San Gabriel Mountains. It now lies in the watershed of San Antonio Creek. In large storm events the Pit 
                        is integral part for our watershed. Due to its abandonment, many native plants have populated the site. The Pit 
                        acts as a semi-natural water filtration system for our water table, allowing for the water that enters the site 
                        from Route 66 to flow through natural filtration before it enters the groundwater. The city of Montclair has a 
                        well just below the site. We are concerned about the CMC and Pitzer plans and the need to mitigate negative 
                        consequences for our water table.

                    <h1>The History</h1>
                    
                    <p>
                        Quincy first began this project in the Fall of 2017. He had just taken a class called Sustainable Place Studio.
                        In this class students take urban planning and environmental design concepts and apply them to issues affecting
                        Claremont, California and the greater Inland Empire. This class is offered every year by Professor Lance Neckar
                        (Pitzer College Professor, EA) After working on water wise landscape in the studio class, Quincy decided he wanted 
                        to take the concepts learned in the class and apply them to issues affecting CMC. He applied to the presidential fund 
                        at CMC. This fund was created to encourage students to develop projects to promote sustainability on campus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project plan was to create a community oriented design within the campus. Due to increased California drought, 
                        CMC has developed a plan for more water wise landscaping. Quincy and Lance hoped to develop a program for the site 
                        that would increase community integration along with provide a landscape system for water quality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After applying, they were told that CMC “does not do projects like ours”. Quincy had developed a model at his home
                        in Portland to model the possibility, but the school, the president, and administration were not receptive. After 
                        receiving the news, Quincy began working with Griffin. The pair attempted again to address these issues however were 
                        unsuccessful during the 2017-2018 academic year. Their only success was to get the CMC president to commit to possible 
                        site development on the East Campus site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In fall of 2018 Quincy took a semester off to work at Lazar Landscape, a high-end landscaping firm in Oakland. Before, Quincy had just finished in introductory masters program at Berkeley in Urban Planning. While Quincy worked in Oakland, Griffin worked in Claremont. During this time, Griffin developed a new project with Lance. He reached out to the Pitzer President who also gave his support to working on the site. Griffin began working with Quincy remotely to develop a plan to address planning potential on the East Campus Site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When Quincy came back for the spring term in 2019. Both were ready to open the site up to community. They enlisted Aviva Jacobs, a fellow EA major to help with development of the project and provide GIS mapping data. However, yet again they were stopped. The president at CMC refused to meet with Quincy. The administration did not want approve the capstone. Pitzer stopped responding to Griffin and Lance. For 4 weeks we were sidelined.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Finally after many frustrating emails and conversation Griffin and Quincy met with members from CMC and Pitzer who are involved with the colleges ideal planning for the project. They seemed respective. We talked about our hopes for the site. They brought us into Pit. They made it seem like we would be able to complete our project. However, yet again we were sidelined.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After sending them the times and dates we needed to enter the site, along with our project outline communication stopped again. Quincy and Griffin both reached out, and after many emails later got the responds that they couldn’t enter the site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They got that news on March 11th, five weeks into our last semester of our senior year, too late to change the project again, too late to try and figure out a different capstone. After going through this, we now know how important it is that we do this work. The colleges do not want student, faculty, or community input into the design process. We will be challenging this. Environmental racism is alive and well, the colleges inaction on distinct restoration needs will and are directly affecting the predominantly latino immigrant community. Furthermore, the Inland Empire is known to have the highest concentration of pollution in California and is an indicator community for economic recessions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        CMC recently had a conference which looked at the economic issues affecting the Inland Empire. Our conference will look deeper into the social, environmental, and economic issues, while taking a site specific look at activism, and environmental justice. Instead of solely looking at the economic wealth of the area, our conference will show that there are distinct cultural, social, and environmental assets. These assets are important to the community. It is imperative that their voices are heard when doing anything in their backyard.

                    <p>
                    Please Join us on April 13th for a planning conference. We will be looking at CMC and Pitzer's roles in fostering community oriented development and sustainability. We will have different professionals from the planning field, students from different colleges, and Claremont professors discuss issues around accessibility and affordability. Breakfast and lunch will be served. After the informational aspect of the conference we will be having a workshop. Our workshop will use the Pit (east campus property) as a case study. How can community oriented design ideals challenge previous plans by the colleges?
